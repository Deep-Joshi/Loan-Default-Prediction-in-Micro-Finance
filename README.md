# Loan-Default-Prediction-in-Micro-Finance

This repository contains all the relevant files used to fetch, process and develop the predictive model in SAS Enterprise Miner. 

Kiva is an online loan lending platform that allows individuals to make small loans to borrowers across the world. Our analysis aims at studying loan defaults across countries having a decent mixture of defaulted and paid loans. Thus, a sample of observations from countries like Ecuador, Kenya and Dominican Republic has been chosen for analysis and model development. These countries have a decent ratio of defaulted loans with respect to paid loans.  

The detailed information about the project can be found in the PDF file - 'Report - Loan Default Prediction in Micro Finance.pdf'
